## Overview

**SAT_SeatFinder** is a lightweight Python script designed to help users quickly check for available SAT testing seats near a given location. It is optimized for use on mobile devices and supports home screen widgets through Python IDEs like **Pyto** on iOS.

## Features

- Simple configuration with minimal code edits  
- Mobile-friendly, ideal for on-the-go use  
- Optional widget support using **Pyto** for iOS  

## Requirements

- iOS device with the [**Pyto** IDE](https://pyto.app) installed  
- Internet access for API requests  

## Getting Started

1. **Download the script**  
   Save the file [`satcenterfinder.py`](./satcenterfinder.py) to your mobile device.

2. **Open in Pyto**  
   Launch the Pyto app and open the script.

3. **Configure your inputs**  
   In the script, find the section marked `# Inputs` and update the following variables:
   ```python
   test_date = "YYYY-MM-DD"      # e.g., "2025-10-04"
   zipcode = "12345"             # your ZIP code
   state = "WA"                  # your state abbreviation
   country = "US"                # country code
   ```

4. **Run the script**  
   Tap the play button in Pyto to execute the script and view seat availability.

5. **(Optional) Set up a widget**  
   Pyto supports adding scripts as widgets to your iOS home screen. Use this feature to monitor seat availability without opening the app.

## Notes

- The script uses public test center availability data and may be subject to rate limits or access changes.
- Be sure to double-check availability and register on the official [College Board](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat) site.
